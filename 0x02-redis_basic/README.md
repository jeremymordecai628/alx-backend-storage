# Learning Objectives

## Learn how to use Redis for basic operations
Redis is an in-memory data structure store, often used as a database, cache, and message broker. By understanding Redis for basic operations, you'll be able to:
- **Store data**: Learn how to save key-value pairs in Redis.
- **Retrieve data**: Understand the commands to fetch stored data.
- **Manipulate data**: Get comfortable with commands to update and delete data.
- **Work with different data types**: Redis supports strings, lists, sets, hashes, and more.

## Learn how to use Redis as a simple cache
Redis can be used as a cache to speed up access to frequently requested data. By learning this, you'll be able to:
- **Implement caching strategies**: Understand how to cache data to reduce load on your primary database.
- **Manage cache expiration**: Learn to set expiration times on cached data to keep the cache fresh.
- **Use Redis commands for caching**: Familiarize yourself with commands like `EXPIRE`, `SETEX`, and `TTL` to manage cache lifetimes.
- **Improve application performance**: Use caching to reduce latency and improve the user experience.

These objectives will set you up to effectively leverage Redis for efficient data handling and improved performance in your applications.
